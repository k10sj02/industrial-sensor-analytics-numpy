# Industrial Sensor Analytics (Numpy)

To make this project more fun and grounded, I’m borrowing the idea from the original TDS article and building my own version of it. Like the author, I’m using a fictional client—EnviroTech Dynamics, a global operator of industrial sensor networks.

EnviroTech currently runs outdated, loop-based Python scripts to process more than a million sensor readings a day. It’s slow, clunky, and delays the maintenance decisions they rely on to keep operations running smoothly. They need something faster, modern, and vectorized.

This notebook is my own NumPy-driven proof of concept, where I reimagine the workflow and show how much we can speed up their data pipeline with cleaner, high-performance techniques.
