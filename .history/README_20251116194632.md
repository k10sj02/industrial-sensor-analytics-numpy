# Industrial Sensor Analytics (Numpy)

To make this project more engaging and hands-on, I’m taking inspiration from the original TDS article and creating my own version. My fictional client is EnviroTech Dynamics, a global operator of industrial sensor networks.

Currently, EnviroTech relies on outdated, loop-based Python scripts to process over a billion sensor readings daily. I scaled the dataset from millions to a billion readings to stress-test memory usage, vectorized operations, and large-scale simulation workloads. Their current workflow is slow and clunky, delaying critical maintenance decisions. They need something faster, modern, and vectorized.

However, be careful, generating one billion iterations in pure Python would take hours or even days. A billion `float64` numbers require roughly 8 GB of RAM (plus overhead), which will crash most laptops. In real-world projects, you’d often work with 1 million rows instead.

This notebook is my NumPy-driven proof of concept, where I reimagine the workflow and demonstrate how cleaner, high-performance techniques can dramatically speed up their data pipeline.
